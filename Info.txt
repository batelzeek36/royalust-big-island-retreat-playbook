ROYALUST × BIG ISLAND RETREAT OPS PLAN  
🛡🪬🛡🪬🛡🪬🛡🪬🛡🪬🛡🪬🛡🪬  


🏞  
═══════════════════════════════  
1) SAFE OPERATING MODE
═══════════════════════════════  
• Now (lowest risk): run day-use, private educational workshops under PMA.  
• Frame as “educational retreats / sustainability workshops” — fits Ag District uses.  
• Later (if overnights): either partner with permitted lodging OR pursue County permits for accommodations + TAT filings.  


🏠  
═══════════════════════════════  
2) STRUCTURES: KEEP THEM LEGAL OR EXEMPT  
═══════════════════════════════  
• Use only permitted or exempt accessory structures (non-habitable, ≤600 sq ft on Ag).  
• NO permanent sleeping or plumbing in exempt sheds/yurts.  
• File Ag-exempt declaration with County if required; keep acknowledgment in binder.  
• Tents >700 sq ft → Fire Dept. permit.  
• Assembly load ≥300 → Assembly permit.  


🧼🍲  
═══════════════════════════════  
3) HEALTH, FOOD & SANITATION
═══════════════════════════════  
• Food prep = DOH Special Event Food Establishment permit OR licensed caterer.  
• Portable toilets + hand-wash stations required; keep service receipts.  
• Document compliance in binder.  


🔒  
═══════════════════════════════  
4) MAKE THE EVENT PRIVATE
═══════════════════════════════  
• Membership application → approval → signed agreement.  
• Website: “Private, members-only; application/invitation only.”  
• No public ticket sales.  
• Gate signage: “Private Event — Members & Invited Guests Only.”  
• Maintain roster on site.  


🏘  
═══════════════════════════════  
5) NEIGHBOR & NUISANCE CONTROLS  
═══════════════════════════════  
• Headcount cap tied to parking capacity.  
• Noise plan & curfew (quiet hours).  
• On-site parking only; use cones/attendant.  
• Neighbor contact phone at entrance; document response.  


📂  
═══════════════════════════════  
6) COMPLIANCE BINDER
═══════════════════════════════  
Must have at every event:  
• TMK zoning printout + Code Ch.25 excerpts.  
• EPIC/Building docs + ag-exempt declarations.  
• Tent/Fire permits, food permits, portable toilet contract.  
• Insurance certs (general liability + participant accident).  
• Member roster + signed agreements + safety briefing sheet.  
• Incident log.  


💰  
═══════════════════════════════  
7) TAXES & FILINGS  
═══════════════════════════════  
• Collect/remit GET on dues/fees.  
• Overnight consideration = TAT (10.25%) + County 3%.  
• File TA-1/TA-2 + County portal.  
• Keep PMA books separate from LLC.  


🚨  
═══════════════════════════════  
8) TRIPWIRES (AUTO PAUSE)
═══════════════════════════════  
• Adding sleeping/plumbing to exempt structure.  
• Using tents >700 sq ft without Fire permit.  
• Advertising public tickets.  
• Scaling headcount beyond safe parking/noise.  
• Any neighbor complaint or inspector visit → pause + remediate.  


📜  
═══════════════════════════════  
9) REASSURANCE TO RICHARD  
═══════════════════════════════  
> We’re locking this down on four fronts:  
> 1️⃣ Private, invitation-only educational day-use retreats under PMA.  
> 2️⃣ Only permitted or exempt non-habitable Ag structures (with tent/FD permits as needed).  
> 3️⃣ DOH food & sanitation support (toilets, handwash, caterers).  
> 4️⃣ A compliance binder + neighbor-friendly operating plan.  

This keeps us aligned with County zoning/building rules ✅ and avoids the triggers that bring inspectors 🚫 while we plan long-term permitted overnight options.

═══════════════════════════════
0) WHICH PERMIT DO WE NEED?
═══════════════════════════════
• If your TMK is in the State Land Use Agricultural/Rural district → apply for a Special Permit (HRS §205-6) via the County Planning Commission.

• Check your State district here → https://luc.hawaii.gov/maps/  (or GIS: https://geoportal.hawaii.gov/datasets/HiStateGIS::state-land-use-districts/about)


═══════════════════════════════
1) PREP & PRE-APPLICATION
═══════════════════════════════
• Confirm TMK, State district, County zoning + constraints:
  – County maps/GIS → https://www.planning.hawaiicounty.gov/resources/resources-references/maps
• Book a pre-application with Hawaiʻi County Planning:
  – “Apply for a land-use permit” hub → https://www.planning.hawaiicounty.gov/i-want-to/apply/for-a-land-use-permit


═══════════════════════════════
2) PICK THE PATH & GATHER EXHIBITS
═══════════════════════════════
• Special Permit (Ag/Rural) — application form (County Planning Commission):
  – PDF → https://records.hawaiicounty.gov/WebLink/1/edoc/55600/Special%20Permit.pdf

═══════════════════════════════
3) FILE, NOTICE & HEARING
═══════════════════════════════
• Submit to County Planning per the permit type (Special or Use). The County sets the hearing, publishes notice, and routes agencies for comment.
• Timeline cue (Use Permit): Public hearing is typically scheduled within ~90 days of acceptance (see Ch.25 procedures).
• Acreage note: If your Special Permit area is >15 acres, final action goes to the State Land Use Commission after the County hearing.


═══════════════════════════════
4) AFTER APPROVAL (CONDITIONS)
═══════════════════════════════
• Read every condition (hours, headcount, parking, sound, tents, sanitation, fire, reporting).
